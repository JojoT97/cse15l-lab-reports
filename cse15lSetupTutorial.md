Select your operating system, press download and install.
After installing open the VScode application.

## Step 2, Remotely Connecting:

After having opened the VScode application, open a new terminal within VScode.
You can open a new terminal within VSCode by going to the top of the VScode window and select
Terminal > New Terminal. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + `. Near the plus icon
in the terminal area, select the arrow. In the dropdown that apears select "Git Bash" as shown here:

Finally, to connect to a remote server type the following command in terminal: `sshcs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replace (zz) with the letters from your course-specific account. Here is what terminal should look like after connecting to the remote server:

## Step 3, Trying Some Commands:

Now that you have connected to a remote server, lets try some commands.
Here are a list of useful commands you can try:

- cd ~
- cd
- ls -lat
- ls -a
- ls (directory) where (directory) is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
- cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/
- cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt


Here is an example of me using a command:

In this example, the cp command copies the borzoi2 image from my otherBorzoi folder to the parent borzois folder.

Here of examples of commands being used after connecting to a remote server:

The pwd command prints the working directory.

The ls command lists everything in the working directory.

The cat command displays data from inside the given file. Since there is no data inside the file nothing was displayed.
