## Step 6:
```c d <space> l <tab>``` 
the keys typed above results in the command ```cd lab7/``` it changes the current directory to the lab7/ directory.

```<up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <enter>```
the keys typed above results in the command ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` which compiles the test files.

```<up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <enter>```
the keys typed above results in the command ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` which runs the test files. However the 
test files shows that there are errors, so i will need to fix them.

## Step 7:
```l s <enter>```
the keys typed above results in the command ```ls``` which i use to list the files in the current directory, which is helpful for using commands on them.

```v i m <space> L i s t <tab> . j a <tab> <enter>```
the keys typed above results in the command ```vim ListExamples.java``` i make use of the tab key to autocomplete certain parts of the command.
What this command does, is allow me to edit the ListExamples.java file so i can fix the issue.

```i <esc> <:> <wq> <enter>```
i use the command i to enter insert mode an edit and fix the file. i use the esc key to exit insert mode, then the rest of the keys typed above results in the command ```:wq```.
the ```:wq``` command is a combination of the ```:w``` command and ```:q``` command, which means the ```:wq``` command both saves and quits the file currently being edited.

## Step 8:
```j a v a c <space> L i s t <tab> . j a <tab> <enter>```
the keys typed above results in the command ```javac ListExamples.java``` i once again make use of the tab key to autocomplete certain parts of the command.
The above command is neccesesary in order to compile the ListExamples.java file so the changes i made can take effect.

```<up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <up arrow> <enter>```
